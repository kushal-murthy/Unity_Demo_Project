# Unity_Demo_Project
This is a demo project to represent the URL response times by GameObjects in Unity
/*
This code plots a sphere for each URL on the unity scene. The spheres are placed in sorted order of time on x-axis and are scaled as per the response size. 
There are 20 URL's in the UrlFile.txt file.
The time taken to fulfil a request is measured naively using System timer without using any high level API.
The size is measured as per the length of HTTP response data.
